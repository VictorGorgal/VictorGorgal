### Hi, I'm Victor ðŸ‘‹

I love programming and electronics, I'm trying to upload more of my personal projects to GitHub to show a bit more of my work.

I'm a fast learner and also like to learn.

Currently working at the Cyber Security and IoT lab (www.inatel.br/csilab).

It's quite common for me to make small side projects to try and push the boundary of what i can do.
