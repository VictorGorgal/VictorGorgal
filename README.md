### Hi, I'm Victor ðŸ‘‹

I love programming and electronics and I'm trying to upload more of my personal projects to GitHub to show a bit more of my work.

I'm a fast learner and also really like to learn new things.

Currently graduating at INATEL in computer engineering and working at PD SoluÃ§Ãµes.

It's quite common for me to make small side projects to try and push the boundaries of what i can do.
